# Introduction

Union Cloud is a workflow orchestration platform based on the Flyte open-source project.

The system is hosted in your own cloud account, and provides a turnkey solution for running machine learning and data pipelines.

Flyte is already used by hundreds of major organizations to run machine learning and data pipelines.
However, it does require platform engineers to maintain, extend, and scale.

Union Cloud abstracts away the required infrastructure, providing a turnkey platform that lets your ML engineers and data scientists focus on what they do best.
