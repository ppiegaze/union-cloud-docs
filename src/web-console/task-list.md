# Task list

Selecting **Tasks** in the sidebar displays a list of all the registered tasks:

![Task list](../../images/task-list.png)

You can search the tasks by name and filter for only those that are archived.

Each task in the list displays some basic information about the task:

* **Inputs**: The input type for the task.
* **Outputs**: The output type for the task.
* **Description**: A description of the task.

Select an entry on the list to go to that [specific task](task-view).
