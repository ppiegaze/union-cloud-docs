# Execution list

The **Execution list** shows all executions in a project and domain combination.
An execution represents a single run of all or part of a workflow (including sub-workflows or individual tasks).

This is the default view when you select a project and domain from the [**Projects list**](index).
You can also access it from the **Executions** link in the left navigation.
