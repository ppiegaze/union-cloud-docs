# Execution view

The execution view appears when you launch a workflow or task or select an already completed execution (in, for example, the [execution list](execution-list)).

An execution represents a single run of all or part of a workflow (including sub-workflows and individual tasks).

::: info Note

An execution usually represents the run of an entire workflow.
But, because workflows are composed of tasks (and sometimes sub-workflows) and Flyte caches the outputs of those independently of the workflows in which they participate, it sometimes makes sense to execute a task or sub-workflow independently.

:::

The execution view provides a lot of detailed information about the execution:

In the top bar:

![](../../images/execution-view-topbar.png)

* **Breadcrumb** showing:
  * **Project**:
  Select the drop down to choose a different project.
  * **Domain**:
  Select the drop down to choose a different project.
  * **Type of entity (workflow or task)**:
  Select the drop down to switch entity types (executions and launch plans are the other two possibilities).
  * **Workflow or task name**:
  Select the drop down to see the current version or select a different one.
  * **ID of this specific execution**:
  Select the drop down choose a different one.
* **Status badge**:
One of **QUEUED**, **RUNNING**, **SUCCEEDED**, **FAILED** or **UNKNOWN**.
* **View Inputs & Outputs** link.
* **Relaunch** button.

Below the top bar, details on the execution (domain, cluster, time, etc.) are displayed:

And below that, three tabs provide access to the **Nodes**, **Graph**, and **Timeline** views:

## Nodes

The default tab within the execution view is the **Nodes** tab.
It shows a list of the Flyte nodes that make up this execution (A node in Flyte is either a task or a (sub-)workflow):

Selecting an item in the list opens the right panel showing more details of that specific node:

![](../../images/execution-view-right-panel.png)

Within the right panel, we can see

* **Node ID**: _n0_
* **Task name**: _workflows.diffuse.start_process_
* **Success status**: _SUCCEEDED_
* **Caching status**: _Caching was disabled for this execution_
* **Type**: _Python Task_
* **Rerun** button

Below that, you have the tabs **Executions**, **Inputs**, **Outputs**, and **Task**.

### Executions

This tab gives you details on the execution of this particular node.

#### Task level monitoring

You can access the [task-level monitoring](task-level-monitoring) information by selecting **View Utilization**.

#### Logs

You can access logs by clicking the text under **Logs**.
In AWS-based systems this will say **CloudWatch Logs**.
In GCP-based system this will say **StackDriver Logs**. See [Logging](logging).

### Inputs

This tab displays the input to this node.:

### Outputs

This tab displays the output of this node:

![](../../images/execution-view-right-panel-outputs.png)

### Task

If this node is Task (as opposed to a sub-workflow) this tab displays the Task definition:

## Graph

The Graph tab displays a visual representation of the execution as a directed acyclic graph:

## Timeline

The Timeline tab displays a visualization showing the timing of each task in the execution:
